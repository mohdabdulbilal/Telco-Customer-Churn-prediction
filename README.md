## 🧠 Project Overview

Telco Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts which telecom customers are likely to stop using the service (churn). Using customer demographics, account info, and service usage patterns, the model helps telecom companies identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset** – Import customer data.
2. **Preprocess** – Clean and encode features.
3. **Train Model** – Train classification models.
4. **Evaluate** – Check performance with metrics.
5. **Deploy** – Serve model through a Streamlit web app.

## 🧾 Results & Insights

The model identifies customers at high risk of churn and helps visualize key factors driving churn such as:

* Tenure
* Contract type
* Monthly charges
* Service usage patterns

These insights enable telecom companies to develop targeted retention strategies.
